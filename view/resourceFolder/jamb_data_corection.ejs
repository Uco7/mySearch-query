    <h1>📅 JAMB Registration 2025 Start Date – Everything You Need to Know</h1>

    <p>The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is the body responsible for conducting the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) in Nigeria. Every year, hundreds of thousands of candidates register to take this exam, which is a key requirement for gaining admission into universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education across the country.</p>

    <p>As the academic year approaches, many students and parents are eager to know the <strong>JAMB registration 2025 start date</strong> so they can begin preparations early. Here's everything you need to know.</p>

    <h2>🗓️ When Will JAMB Registration for 2025 Start?</h2>
    <p>While the official date for the 2025 JAMB registration has not yet been announced by the board, based on previous years' patterns, <strong>JAMB registration typically begins between late January and early February</strong>. For instance:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In 2023, registration started on <strong>January 14th</strong></li>
      <li>In 2024, it commenced on <strong>January 15th</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If this trend continues, <strong>JAMB 2025 registration is expected to start in the second or third week of January 2025</strong>, and it usually lasts for about 4–6 weeks.</p>

    <p>However, it's important to <strong>wait for the official announcement from JAMB</strong> through their website <a href="https://www.jamb.gov.ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jamb.gov.ng</a>, social media pages, or credible educational news platforms like School Search, Myschool.ng or AllSchool.ng.</p>

    <h2>🧾 What You’ll Need Before Registration</h2>
    <p>Before registration begins, candidates are advised to have the following ready:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>NIN (National Identification Number)</strong> – Mandatory for registration</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Email Address & Phone Number</strong> – Must be active and accessible</li>
      <li><strong>O’Level Results (WAEC, NECO, NABTEB)</strong> – Can be uploaded later, but recommended</li>
      <li><strong>Correct Bio Data</strong> – Full name, date of birth, state & local government of origin</li>
      <li><strong>Choice of Institutions & Courses</strong> – Be sure of your preferences</li>
      <li><strong>JAMB Profile Code</strong> – Generated by sending “NIN <em>your 11-digit NIN</em>” to 55019 or 66019</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📝 Final Tips</h2>
    <p>As the registration period approaches, keep an eye on official JAMB channels. Avoid falling victim to fraud by using only approved registration centers and cybercafés. Prepare all documents in advance and follow instructions carefully during registration.</p>
